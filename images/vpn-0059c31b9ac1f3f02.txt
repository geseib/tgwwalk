# Amazon Web Services
# Virtual Private Cloud
#
# AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of 
# a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned a VPN Connection Identifier
# and is associated with two other identifiers, namely the 
# Customer Gateway Identifier and the Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
#

# Your VPN Connection ID  		    : vpn-0059c31
# Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : 
# Your Customer Gateway ID 		    : cgw-0d70048687972a018
#
# This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be 
# configured on your Customer Gateway.
#
#

# IPSec Tunnel #1

# #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
#
# A proposal is established for the supported IKE encryption, 
# authentication, Diffie-Hellman, and lifetime parameters.
# Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
# Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
# The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
# To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500. If not behind NAT, we recommend disabling NAT-T.
